# Logistig-regression-Random-forest
i use randon forest over lr for classification sadly my data is lost, data is paramters of working java program with diffrent platforms.
As a result of these paramters error-errors accure or not.

first Lr finds there will be error with given parameters or not then with errored data how many error is occurred is find with random forest
for first algorthm, i use diffrent algorthm written(gapper) by me and thanks to that i have %100 accurcy 
however on website like %70 accurcy is expected is said.
