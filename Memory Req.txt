The estimate for the memory requirements of a reinforcement learning task being a few hundred 
megabytes to a couple of gigabytes is a rough estimate based on typical memory requirements for training neural networks.

Calculate required memory (just idea not exact)

If you have 100,000 parameters in your neural network, and you are using a batch size of 32, the memory 
required to store the activations during a forward pass would be 32 * 100,000 * 4 bytes/parameter = 12.8 GB (assuming 32-bit floating-point data type).

The memory required to store the gradients during a backward pass would be similarly calculated,
and the total memory requirements for a forward and backward pass would be around 25.6 GB.
